# SASS for NOOBS!
Sass is nothing but a CSS preprocessor. It helps you write faster css.
It's easier than you think! In this tutorial, we'll install sass on our computer.
Sass runs on Ruby. No need to worry if you don't know anything about Ruby. You just have to have it on your computer.

## MAC
If you're using OSX, Ruby is already preinstalled. To check if you’re running the updated version type the following in your terminal.
```
ruby -v
```
If the version number is lower than 2.0.0, type the following command (This will update ruby to the latest version)

```
sudo gem install ruby

``` 

Once that's done, the only thing left is to install SASS on your system:

```
sudo gem install sass

```
DONE! We're all set up.


## Windows
The process is much simpler on windows. Go to this [Link](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and choose which version to install. Find the 2.1.x link, and choose the (x64) version if your PC is running the 64-bit version.

Once downloaded, run the setup like how you would for normally do for any other program.
After you’ve installed Ruby, you need to confirm that Ruby is installed. To do that,  open up the Command Prompt and type:
```
ruby -v
```
After confirming, the last step is to install SASS:

```
gem install sass
```
That's all! Now you can start using SASS in your projects.
