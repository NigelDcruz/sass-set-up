# SASS for NOOBS!
Sass is nothing but a CSS preproccessor. It helps you write faster css.
It's easier than you think! In this tutorial, we'll install sass on our computer.
Sass runs on Ruby. No need to worry if you don't know anything about Ruby. You just have to have it on your computer.

## MAC
If you're using OSX, Ruby is already preinstalled. To check if youâ€™re running the updated version type the following in your terminal.
```
ruby -v
```
If the version number is lower than 2.0.0, type the following command (This will update ruby to the latest version)

```
sudo gem install ruby

``` 

Once that's done, the only thing left is to install SASS on your system:

```
sudo gem install sass

```
DONE! We're all set up.
